# Gorilla

This is a definition dumper for the HEK. It dumps definitions into JSON which can be easily parsed.

The usage is as follows:

    gorilla <path-to-guerilla.exe> <output-file.json>

Note that this only dumps definitions for data stored in tag files. The internal representation of the tags in a cache file will vary.
